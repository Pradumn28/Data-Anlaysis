📈 Stock Market Analysis (NSE) using Pandas & Plotly

This project analyzes 5 selected stocks from the NSE (National Stock Exchange of India) and performs detailed studies on their price trends, volatility, and cumulative returns.
The goal of this project is to showcase my familiarity with Pandas and Plotly — two powerful Python libraries for data manipulation and interactive visualization.
🚀 **Project Overview**

**Using Pandas, I:**

1.Cleaned and pre-processed raw stock price CSV files

2.Extracted useful insights (returns, volatility, trends)

3.Prepared the data for visualization

**Using Plotly, I:**

1.Built interactive stock price charts

2.Visualized daily volatility in returns

3.Compared cumulative returns of the chosen stocks

🔍 Key Analysis

📊 Trends in Stock Prices – Daily price changes across selected NSE stocks

📉 Volatility of Returns – Measuring the ups and downs in daily returns

📈 Cumulative Returns – Long-term performance comparison across stocks

📌 How to Explore the Project

👉 1. Quick Look

Open the images/ folder for static snapshots of the charts.

👉 2. Full Interactivity (Recommended)

-GitHub does not support interactive Plotly charts directly.

To explore full interactivity:

-Download the file: html/project.html

-Open it in your browser

-You’ll be able to zoom, hover, and explore the charts interactively 🎉

👉 3. Technical Code

Check technical_code.ipynb for the full Jupyter Notebook code (data cleaning + analysis + charts).

🛠️ Technologies Used
