# 📈 Stock Market Analysis (NSE) using Pandas & Plotly

This project analyzes **5 selected stocks from the NSE (National Stock Exchange of India)** and performs detailed studies on their **price trends, volatility, and cumulative returns**.  

The goal of this project is to **showcase my familiarity with Pandas and Plotly** — two powerful Python libraries for **data manipulation** and **interactive visualization**.

## 🚀 Project Overview  

Using **Pandas**, I:  
✔️ Cleaned and pre-processed raw stock price CSV files  
✔️ Extracted useful insights (returns, volatility, trends)  
✔️ Prepared the data for visualization  

Using **Plotly**, I:  
✔️ Built **interactive stock price charts**  
✔️ Visualized **daily volatility in returns**  
✔️ Compared **cumulative returns** of the chosen stocks

## 📌 How to Explore the Project  

👉 **1. Quick Look**  
- Open the `images/` folder for static snapshots of the charts.  

👉 **2. Full Interactivity (Recommended)**  
- GitHub does **not support interactive Plotly charts directly**.  
- To explore full interactivity:  
  1. Download the file: [`html/project.html`](./html/project.html)  
  2. Open it in your browser  
  3. You’ll be able to **zoom, hover, and interact** with the charts 🎉  

👉 **3. Technical Code**  
- Check `technical_code.ipynb` for the full Jupyter Notebook code (data cleaning + analysis + charts).
